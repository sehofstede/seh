This is the theme for SenseHofstede.nl

Because the CSS, JavaScript and HTML can be accessed by anyone via the 
browser anyway, I am hosting it in a public repository for the benefit of
all of mankind, etc.

Feel free to reuse what I've done for your own projects, but please do not
copy the look and feel of my site.

Thanks!
